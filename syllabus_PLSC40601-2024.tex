\paragraph{Course overview.} This is a graduate-level course considering modern advances in causal inference and experimental design. In particular, we will consider how machine learning methods can be leveraged to address causal questions. We will read a selection of papers introducing and implementing techniques and research designs, with applications to the social and health sciences and public policy. We will discuss what these new methods are able to offer, and where they may have limitations. The course will be oriented around class discussion and student presentations on the readings. An introductory course in probability and statistics is required; this prerequisite can be met by courses in statistics, biostatistics, economics, political science, sociology, or related fields. Coursework in causal inference is recommended but not required; additional reading references will be provided for students who have not had prior exposure to causal inference methodology. Instructor consent required.


\paragraph{Reference readings.}
This class will not follow a textbook, but some of the methods and approaches may be new to students. For reference for machine learning methods, I recommend:
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{hastie2009elements} \vskip 2 ex

A free pdf version of the book is available at the publisher's website: \url{https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7}
\end{itemize}


Other machine learning references are :
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{murphy2012machine}
\item \bibentry{bishop2006pattern}
\end{itemize}

Many of the papers we read in this course will use potential outcomes notation. Students who have not had recent coursework on causal inference should read the first few chapters of either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\bibentry{hernan2010causal}

A free pdf version of the book is available at the author's website: \url{https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/
causal-inference-book/}
\item 
Or\\
\bibentry{imbens2015causal}
\end{itemize}

As well the materials for PLSC 30600: Causal Inference are available at \url{https://github.com/UChicago-pol-methods/plsc-30600-causal-inference}. 

Much of the statistical theory referenced in readings is covered in this book: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{lehmann1999elements}
\end{itemize}

Also useful for econometrics references:
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{angrist2009}
\end{itemize}



\paragraph{Presentations.}
Each student will be responsible for presenting and leading discussion on one of the required papers, beginning the second week of the quarter. Discussion leaders will provide a 15-20 minute total high-level overview of the paper, and will develop a list of discussion questions. For classes with multiple leaders, co-discussion leaders may divide papers among themselves or may collaborate. Discussion questions should be submitted to the instructor by email the evening before class. 

\paragraph{Two pages referee report.}
Select one of the papers on the syllabus, including from the additional references. Write a referee report as if you were requested to review the paper for publication at a top journal, summarizing the paper's main contributions, areas that could be strengthened, and additional extensions or analyses that you would like to see. Submit the referee report on Canvas the night before the paper is discussed in class. The paper selected for the referee report cannot be from the same class as the class presentation. 
References on how to write a referee report:
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{berk2016preparing}
 \item \url{https://chrisblattman.com/blog/2012/01/18/how-to-referee-an-academic-paper/}
 \end{itemize}

%\paragraph{Five pages single spaced summary paper.} (Seven pages hard cap, longer is not always better.)
\paragraph{Final project}
The final project is a work of exposition/tutorial in which you explore a topic related to development in machine learning for causal inference both analytically and computationally.  Discuss the foundations for this work in statistics or related fields. Then, choose and focus on some aspect of how this work has developed, competing methodologies or debates with associated benefits and drawbacks, and directions for future research. Demonstrate the ideas with a computational example (i.e. write code). The deliverable is a ~5-7 page paper that can include focused code snippets and key output as well as a script or notebook and related data that can be run all the way through after setting the working directory. For example, you can write an Rmd or Jupyter notebook where only the most important code and output for understanding your point is shown in the pdf output.  The reader of your report should come away with a good understanding of the strengths and drawbacks of the method / theme as well as how to implement.

You will be graded not only on the accuracy of your analysis, but also on the clarity of your exposition, which includes notation, typesetting (equation alignment, exceeding margins), grammar, figures, tables, etc. All code should be reproducible--please provide any supporting files necessary with your submission. 
The more difficulty we have in reading your work, the fewer points you will receive. Follow a coding style guide  (e.g.s \url{https://style.tidyverse.org/} and \url{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}). We want to see polished work.

Alternatively, students may submit original work, such as a research proposal for a project they are working on. This option is available with instructor permission only.

Timeline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Paper topics and proposals for original work must be emailed to the instructor and TA by the Wednesday of week 4.  
\item Meet with the TA to present work-in-progress before the end of week 7. Send the current state of your work as well as a short email describing your current challenges and areas you would like feedback on 24 hours before the meeting. 
\item Submit the assignment by 11:59 PM on the Friday of finals week.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Accommodations:} Please reach out to me directly if you would like to request accommodations for the course to better facilitate your learning. Student Disability Services (\url{https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/}) is also available to provide you resources and support, and may provide approval for specific academic accommodations. If you or your household is affected by the ongoing pandemic in a way that affects your ability to participate in or attend class, please reach out to me as well. Informing me in a timely manner will help me to ensure accommodations are met and I am able to implement an appropriate assessment of your learning.
